Crucial to this project is understanding the construction of whiteness in relation to surveillance, and the ways racialization functions in normalizing consumption as free labor. Unpacking the regimes of corporate surveillance, especially voluntary corporate surveillance, necessitates reading in racial capitalism, and how racism is produced by voluntary surveillance.

When asked about corporate, ambient surveillance, "I don't mind surveillance because I have nothing to hide, I'm not a criminal", is a statement I have heard in response, during preliminary research interviews. These kinds of statements rely on a historical, deeply racist construction of criminality that, as scholar Ruha Benjamin points out, produces crime through surveillance of populations. By this logic, to deny or oppose surveillance is to implicate oneself as guilty by default.

A range of contemporary work across different fields has been written about "surveillance capitalism" and self-exploitation that examine such labor from a structural angle. Yet to fully understand the phenomenon of messageboards like "ChinkShitGeneral" or the

Works such as Burawoy's 1974 Marxist classic that looks at the labor process emphasize the notion of gamification -- how laboring gets turned into a game for workers, and this game is produced by the machines and people in power in order to create a sense of pleasure for workers to labor. Current trends in information studies (Rosenblatt, TK) emphasize the game like qualities of gig work, and how new occupations, like the free labor we do to generate data, can be seen in light of gamification. Through a network of incentives, or "carrots and sticks", we willingly part with our data online, whether through shopping or tweeting. This data fuels the corporate profits of big tech corporations, and these corporations go on to use our own data against us, via targeted advertising et we willingly labor on, clicking for the pleasure of interaction, since we have been incentivized to do so -- or at least according to the theory of gamification.

While Burawoy's critique is valuable, his study was situated in an industrial economy with a stringently Marxist view of labor and production as separate from the superstructure of culture. What complicates notions of online shopping as surveillance and data generation is the nature of pleasure itself: it has

cybernetics and construction of human, encoding race -- intrinsically embedded is furthering the logic of racial capitalism 
how does shopping further codify racial logics
lack of family safety net -> push towards mlms
gamification doesn't take into account that

surveillance as "nothing to hide" criminalization


gamification as inadequate
self exploitation and addictive design
there's all these other issues: of culture, etc
