Lisa Nakamura | 2002 |


1. Written during the first dotcom boom, Nakamura sketches out the first wave of techno-liberatarianism
2. At the time, race was seen as a "given" - the idea that the internet would either eradicate or increase racism, change everything or nothing
3. Nakamura is concerned with one level above, zooming out and examining what she refers to (Manovich's) ideas of the cultural and computer layer.
4. Central question: What kind of WORK is race doing? Here, reference to Spivak, "essentialism is a trap", visibility requires distilling down to certain categories. To be seen as POC, requires acceptance of the category.
5. *Cybertypes* **!!!!!!** is a process, a transcoding, but basically the idea of race online as more than just racial streotypes ported over into the virtual. Cybertypes can reify existing cultural logic in machine interactivity or "redress" anxieties about the threats to whiteness in an online culture.
6. References Thomas Foster - notion of information processing centered around the visual as reinforcing racism.
